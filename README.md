homepool started life as a fork of [Pooly](https://github.com/aurel-f/pooly), created by
[aurel-f](https://github.com/aurel-f) — the original app, its data model, and the core
idea of a clean, self-hosted pool/spa tracker all trace back to that project. homepool has
since grown into its own thing (new name, Home Assistant integration, salt-pool support,
configurable ranges, and more), so it's no longer maintained as a fork, but credit for the
original idea belongs there. If you like this project, go star the
[original repository](https://github.com/aurel-f/pooly) too.

### 🌊 Overview

homepool is a **self-hosted** web application to track the maintenance of your pools and spas. Log your water measurements, treatments and maintenance tasks from a clean dashboard — your data stays on your own server.

Designed for self-hosters and the Home Assistant crowd who want full control without complexity: one Docker command and you're up and running, with a first-class HA integration — including a purpose-built Lovelace card — to bring your water parameters into your existing smart-home setup.

**Features:**

- **Water status board** — mono-value param tiles with status dot, ideal range, and per-parameter trend sparkline
- **Home Assistant integration** — sensors, maintenance- and treatment-logging, and a custom Lovelace card, installable via HACS. Already own a smart probe? Point any reading at your own HA entity, and optionally have its readings logged back into homepool
- **One way to log** — an entry is a **measurement**, a **treatment** or a **maintenance** entry, and the treatment and maintenance choices are exactly the products and tasks you configured and enabled (no separate action/extra taxonomy to learn)
- **Log it whenever you get round to it** — every entry carries a date you can set, in the app and from Home Assistant, so a reading you took on Sunday still lands on Sunday
- **Maintenance tasks are just yours** — a new pool arrives with a sensible default set (filter cleaning, water change, …), but they are ordinary tasks: rename, re-icon, retime or delete any of them, exactly like the ones you add yourself
- **So is your product shelf** — treatments come from a per-pool catalog seeded for your type and sanitizer (pH ±, alkalinity, shock, algaecide, clarifier, …), and every product is equally ordinary: rename, re-icon, change its default unit, disable or delete it, or add the specific brand you actually buy. Record how much went in, in whichever unit you measure it
- **AquaChek test strip input** — interactive color chart for pH, Alkalinity, Bromine, Chlorine and Hardness (manual entry is the default; the app remembers whichever you used last)
- **Digital device input** — decimal inputs with range validation
- **Multi-installation** — manage multiple pools and spas with adapted reference ranges
- **Pool sharing** — give another account read-only or read-and-log access to one of your pools, for a partner, a housemate or the person who looks after it while you're away
- **Bromine, chlorine or salt** — differentiated ideal ranges per sanitizer, including a full salt water generator (SWG) profile: higher CYA, a matching free-chlorine target, and a lower total alkalinity target to slow the pH rise SWG cells cause
- **FROG @ease / SmartChlor** — a categorical cartridge status (OK / replace) instead of a numeric free-chlorine target; pH, alkalinity and hardness are tracked like any other sanitizer, using FROG's own interactive test-strip color chart, and chlorine dosing recommendations are simply never generated for this system
- **Configurable ideal ranges** — override any water-parameter range per installation, right from the UI
- **Dosage recommendations** — out-of-range params get a targeted dosing suggestion (liquid CYA now gets a real active-ingredient estimate instead of just "check the bottle"), plus a what-if simulator with slider inputs bounded by your installation's own acceptable ranges and prefilled from your latest reading
- **Full history** — monthly timeline, type filters, full-text search
- **Dark mode** — light, dark or automatic theme (system preference)
- **PWA** — installable on mobile, bottom navigation, bottom sheet modal
- **Self-hosted & private** — no third-party cloud, no tracking, your data stays yours

### 🚀 Quick start

**Requirements**: Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

homepool publishes prebuilt images to GitHub Container Registry, so you do not
need to compile anything — `docker compose up -d` pulls the exact artifact CI
built and tested.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alecc08/homepool.git
cd homepool

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Set your passwords and secrets

# 3. Start homepool (pulls the published images)
docker compose up -d

# 4. Open in your browser
open http://localhost:8090
```

#### Images

| image | |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/alecc08/homepool-web` | frontend (React + Nginx) |
| `ghcr.io/alecc08/homepool-api` | backend (FastAPI) |

Both are built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so a Raspberry Pi works the
same as an x86 server.

By default compose uses `:latest`. **Pin a version instead** if you would rather
decide when to upgrade — set `HOMEPOOL_TAG` in your `.env`:

```bash
HOMEPOOL_TAG=1.12.1
```

The web and API images always share a version number and are released together;
do not mix tags between them.

Every image carries a signed build provenance attestation, so you can verify
where it came from before running it:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/alecc08/homepool-web:latest -R alecc08/homepool
```

#### Building from source instead

Prefer to compile it yourself? Add the build override — no other changes needed:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8090`. Create your account on first login.

> **The first account you create is the instance administrator.** There are no admin
> credentials to set in `.env` — an administrator manages accounts and can close public
> sign-ups from the **Administration** panel in the sidebar. Upgrading an existing
> instance? Your oldest account is promoted to administrator automatically on first boot.
---

### 👥 Sharing a pool

Pools belong to the account that created them, but you can give other accounts access to
one — a partner who logs the measurements, a housemate, or whoever looks after the pool
while you're away.

Open the pool's edit dialog (the ✏️ next to the installation picker) → **Sharing**, enter
the other person's homepool email address and pick their level of access:

| Access | Can |
|---|---|
| **Read-only** | See the dashboard, water parameters, history and dosing recommendations |
| **Read and log** | The above, plus log measurements, treatments and mark maintenance done |

The pool's **owner** keeps everything else: renaming it, capacity and units, target ranges,
maintenance task configuration, managing shares, and deleting it. Sharing is by account, so
the other person needs to have signed up on your instance first — there are no invitation
emails to configure.

Shared pools show up in the recipient's installation picker labelled with the owner's name,
and in their **Home Assistant integration** too: their API key lists shared pools alongside
their own, so they get the same sensors and cards. Write actions still respect the role — a
read-only user's maintenance buttons are refused by the API.

Either side can end a share: the owner revokes it from the Sharing tab, the recipient uses
**Leave this installation** from the pool's dialog.

---

### 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

homepool ships a full Home Assistant integration: sensors for every water parameter, maintenance-due tracking, one-tap maintenance buttons, and a custom **homepool card** for your dashboard.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=homepool)

#### 1. Install via HACS

Settings → HACS → custom repositories (⋮ menu) → add repository URL `https://github.com/alecc08/homepool`, category **Integration** → find "homepool" in HACS → Install.

#### 2. Add the integration

Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search for "homepool".

#### 3. Configure

- **Base URL**: your homepool server URL. If you're running behind the bundled nginx/reverse-proxy setup, this **must include the `/api` path** — e.g. `https://your-domain/api`, not just `https://your-domain`. Using the domain without `/api` will result in a "failed to connect to the homepool server" error.
- **API Key**: generate one from Settings → API Key in the homepool web app.

#### 4. Entities

Each installation gets a device with the following entities:

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.<installation>_ph`, `_chlorine`, `_bromine`, `_tac`, `_hardness`, `_salt`, `_stabilizer_cya`, `_combined_chlorine`, `_temperature` | One sensor per measured water parameter — only created for fields your installation actually tracks (or that you mapped to one of your own entities, see [Custom sensors](#6-custom-sensors--use-your-own-probes)). Carries `date`, and (server permitting) `status` (`ok`/`warn`/`danger`) and `ideal_min`/`ideal_max` attributes. Never created for `_chlorine` on a FROG @ease SmartChlor installation — see the SmartChlor sensor below instead. |
| `sensor.<installation>_smartchlor` | FROG @ease SmartChlor cartridge status — an `ENUM` sensor with state `ok` or `out`, only created once a strip check has been logged. Carries `date` and a friendly `status_text` ("OK — cartridge active" / "OUT — replace cartridge") attribute. Never a numeric free-chlorine value. |
| `sensor.<installation>_days_until_ph_measurement_due`, `_days_until_filter_maintenance_due` | Plain numeric "days until due" sensors (not on/off) that go negative once overdue, so you can set your own automation threshold instead of a fixed one, e.g. `states('sensor.xxx_days_until_ph_measurement_due') \| int <= 3`. |
| `sensor.<installation>_history` | Recent activity (measurements, treatments, maintenance) — state is the entry count, with the entries themselves on the `entries` attribute. Powers the `homepool-history-card`. |
| `sensor.<installation>_treatments` | The products you can log a treatment with — state is the product count, with the catalog itself (`key`, `label`, `icon`, `default_unit`, `param`) on the `treatments` attribute. Powers the card's "Log treatment" picker, and the `key` values are what `homepool.log_treatment` accepts. |
| `button.<installation>_log_<task>` — e.g. `_log_filter_maintenance`, `_log_water_change`, `_log_ph_calibration` | One button per maintenance task you enabled, whether it came with the pool or you added it. Press to log it against homepool immediately, no app needed. To log one for a *past* day, use the `homepool.log_maintenance` service instead. |

#### 5. The homepool card

A hand-written Lovelace card ships with the integration (no separate frontend install) — it mirrors the web app's water-status-board look: mono values, a status dot per parameter, an ideal/acceptable range gauge, and a "measured N days ago" readout, plus one button per enabled maintenance task and "Log measurement" / "Log treatment" buttons that open a popup form. The measurement form adapts its fields to your installation's sanitizer (chlorine/bromine/salt/FROG @ease SmartChlor), with a "more fields" toggle for hardness, CYA and notes; the treatment form offers your installation's own product catalog, with the amount, unit (pre-filled from the product) and an optional brand. Either button can be hidden from the card's visual editor.

Each parameter tile is interactive: **tap the tile** to open the log-measurement popup focused on that field, or **tap the 📈 icon** to open Home Assistant's native more-info dialog (history graph) for that sensor. Pressing a maintenance button flashes a "✓ Logged" confirmation.

<div align="center">

| The card | Logging a treatment from it |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/hass-main-card.png" alt="homepool card in Home Assistant" width="330"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/hass-treatment-form.png" alt="the card's log-treatment popup" width="330"> |

</div>

Add it from the card picker (search "homepool") or with YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:homepool-card
title: My pool
entity_prefix: sensor.my_pool
installation_id: 1
show_buttons: true
show_due: true
```

`entity_prefix` should match the prefix HA generated for your installation's sensors (e.g. `sensor.my_pool_ph` → prefix `sensor.my_pool`). `installation_id` is only needed if you want the "Log measurement" popup and tile-tap logging — find it in the homepool web app's URL or API. In the card's visual editor, you can skip typing either by hand: pick any one of your installation's sensors from the entity picker and both fields are derived from it automatically.

Everything the visual editor exposes has a YAML equivalent:

| Option | Default | Does what |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | `homepool` | Card heading. Also what's stripped off the front of each tile's label, so setting it to the pool's name keeps the tiles reading `PH`, `CHLORINE`, … |
| `show_header` | `true` | The title row. |
| `show_logo` | `true` | The homepool mark beside the title. |
| `show_due` | `true` | The "due in N days" chips along the top. |
| `show_buttons` | `true` | The whole **Quick add** row. |
| `parameters` | all | Restrict which tiles render, e.g. `[ph, chlorine, temp]`. |
| `quick_add` | all shown | Hide individual quick-add buttons: `{ log_treatment: false }` drops the Log treatment button, and a maintenance task's own key drops its button. |

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/screenshots/hass-card-editor.png" alt="the homepool card's visual editor" width="330">

</div>

> If the card doesn't appear after installing/updating, hard-refresh your browser — the resource is cache-busted per release, but browsers occasionally hold onto a stale copy. As a manual fallback, add the resource yourself: Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → Add Resource → URL `/homepool/homepool-card.js`, type JavaScript Module.

Prefer a more configurable, general-purpose pool widget instead? The [Pool Monitor Card](https://github.com/wilsto/pool-monitor-card) (installable via HACS as a frontend repository) also works against homepool's sensor entities.

> Dosage recommendations are web-app-only for now — the card doesn't surface them yet.

**History card.** A companion `homepool-history-card` renders a compact, read-only table of recent activity — measurements, treatments and maintenance — sourced from the `sensor.<prefix>_history` entity the integration exposes. Set `max_items` to cap the rows, and optionally filter with `types`:

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/screenshots/hass-history-card.png" alt="homepool history card in Home Assistant" width="360">

</div>

```yaml
type: custom:homepool-history-card
title: My pool
entity_prefix: sensor.my_pool
max_items: 20
types: [measurement, treatment, maintenance]
```

#### 6. Custom sensors — use your own probes

Got a smart pH probe, an ORP/temperature sensor, or a template sensor that already knows your water? You can point any homepool reading at it instead of the value homepool last recorded: **Settings → Devices & Services → homepool → Configure**, pick the pool or spa, then choose an entity for each reading you want to override (leave one empty to keep homepool's own value).

The override happens *inside* the homepool sensor, so nothing else changes: `sensor.<installation>_ph` simply starts reflecting your probe, and the homepool card, the history card, your automations and your dashboards all keep working untouched. Two extra attributes tell you what's going on:

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `source_entity_id` | The entity you mapped to this reading |
| `source` | `external` while the mapped entity is providing the value, `homepool` while it's falling back |

**It falls back rather than breaking.** If the mapped entity goes `unavailable`/`unknown`, reports something non-numeric, or uses a unit that can't be reconciled with your installation's (g/L vs ppm, °dH vs ppm), the sensor quietly reverts to homepool's own value. Units that *can* be reconciled are converted for you — °F/°C/K for temperature, ppm ⇄ mg/L for concentrations. The `status` dot (ok/warn/danger) is recomputed against the live external value using your installation's own ideal/acceptable bands, so the card's colours match what's on screen.

A reading you've mapped gets a sensor even if homepool has never recorded that parameter — handy for a probe measuring something you don't test by hand.

**Optional: write the readings back to homepool.** The same screen has a *"Write these readings back to homepool"* toggle (off by default). Turn it on and Home Assistant logs your mapped readings as real homepool measurements, so they show up in the web app's history and feed its dosing advice. It's deliberately restrained: it checks once per interval (default 60 minutes, configurable), records **one** measurement carrying all mapped readings, and only when at least one of them actually changed since the last write — so a stable pool doesn't accumulate an identical row every hour. Readings are rounded to the precision homepool records, which also filters out probe noise. Read-only shared pools simply log a warning instead of writing.

#### 7. The `homepool.log_measurement`, `log_treatment` and `log_maintenance` services

For measurements (pH, chlorine, etc.), call the `homepool.log_measurement` service from a script, automation, or a dashboard button's `tap_action: perform-action`:

```yaml
type: button
tap_action:
  action: perform-action
  perform_action: homepool.log_measurement
  target: {}
  data:
    installation_id: 1
    ph: 7.2
    chlorine: 1.5
name: Log measurement
icon: mdi:flask-outline
```

For a FROG @ease SmartChlor installation, use `smartchlor_status` (`ok` or `out`) instead of `chlorine` — no numeric free-chlorine value is required or accepted for this system:

```yaml
action: homepool.log_measurement
data:
  installation_id: 1
  ph: 7.4
  tac: 100
  hardness: 200
  smartchlor_status: ok
```

For something you added to the water, `homepool.log_treatment` records the product and how much. `treatment` is the product key — one of the keys on your installation's `sensor.<installation>_treatments` entity. `unit` is optional and defaults to the product's own unit, and `brand` is free text for the product you actually bought:

```yaml
action: homepool.log_treatment
data:
  installation_id: 1
  treatment: ph_increaser
  qty: "250"
  brand: HTH Super
```

For maintenance, `homepool.log_maintenance` marks a task done. `task` is the task key — the `task_key` attribute published by that task's "days until due" sensor and its "log" button:

```yaml
action: homepool.log_maintenance
data:
  installation_id: 1
  task: filter_maintenance
  notes: Backwashed until the sight glass ran clear
```

**Forgot to log it on the day?** All three services take an optional `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) that records the entry against a past day instead of today — the same thing the date field on the web app's entry form does:

```yaml
action: homepool.log_maintenance
data:
  installation_id: 1
  task: water_change
  date: "2026-07-24"
```

---

### ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | — |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session secret key | — |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public app URL | `http://localhost:8090` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins | `http://localhost:8090` |
| `DEBUG` | Debug mode (logs reset links) | `false` |

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file**. It is already in `.gitignore`.

#### Customizing ideal water-parameter ranges

Every ideal/acceptable range shown in the app (pH, free chlorine, salt, CYA, alkalinity, hardness, temperature...) has sensible built-in defaults per installation type and sanitizer — including a salt water generator (SWG) profile with a higher CYA target (60-80 ppm), a matching free-chlorine band, and a lower total alkalinity target (60-80 ppm, vs. 80-180 ppm for manually-dosed pools) since SWG cells raise pH over time and a lower TA slows that rise — following [PoolMath](https://www.troublefreepool.com/blog/poolmath/) / Trouble Free Pool guidance. FROG @ease SmartChlor installations track pH, alkalinity and hardness the same way (targets per FROG's own product guidance), but deliberately skip a free-chlorine target and dosing workflow entirely — SmartChlor self-regulates at a consistent free-chlorine level, and cartridge replacement is read straight off the test strip's Out Indicator instead. If your setup runs differently, open an installation's edit modal → **Water Chemistry Targets** tab to customize any band per installation, right from the UI — no env vars or restarts required.

**Switching sanitizer/strip type never touches history.** Every logged entry remembers which strip profile it was taken with, so old AquaChek readings stay AquaChek readings and old FROG SmartChlor checks stay readable even after you change an installation's sanitizer. Any free-chlorine target you'd customized before switching to FROG is kept (just hidden while FROG is active) and reappears exactly as you left it if you switch back.
